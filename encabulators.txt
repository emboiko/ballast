BASE:

Industrial technical illustration of a fictional retroencabulator, rendered as a pseudo-schematic cutaway diagram with selective cutaways.
The machine is complex, over-engineered, and partially transparent, with exposed internal components, impossible mechanical linkages, and speculative technology.

ILLUSTRATION VS SCHEMATIC*

ERA:

Style inspired by mid-to-late 20th-century institutional engineering documentation.

(Early / Primitive Encabulators)

Style inspired by mid-20th-century engineering manuals, patent drawings, and Cold War research documents. 
Line-forward illustration with minimal color, simplified materials, and visibly crude components.

(Transitional / Institutional Growth)

Style inspired by late-20th-century industrial documentation and laboratory schematics. 
Increased material complexity, modular assemblies, standardized housings, and early composite materials.

(Modern / Deep-Facility Monstrosities)

Style inspired by late Aperture-Labs or Black-Mesa internal documentation. 
Advanced composites, sealed modules, layered transparency, dense component packing, and non-human design logic.

(Floating exploded components)

Floating exploded compoents

TEXT CONTROL:

Any text or labels are minimal, clean, and legible.
Simple sans-serif technical lettering only.
Text is secondary to the diagram.

Includes selective cutaways, schematic flow lines, arbitrary sectional cuts, and partially labeled subsystems.
Annotations are sparse, confident, and slightly vague.
Some labels reference fictional processes, subsystems, or measurements.
Not all parts are explained.

(No text)

No annotations.
No text, labels, or lettering is used.

FORM FACTOR:

The machine is non-rotational and non-cylindrical.
Form factor resembles an industrial cabinet or enclosed apparatus.
Rectilinear geometry with stacked modules, compartments, drawers, panels, and access doors.
Asymmetrical layout with no central axis.

(Rotational)

The machine is rotational and cylindrical.
The machine is vaguely rotational in nature
The machine is mounted on its side
The machine features a propeller or fan blade

(Cabinet)

The machine is non-rotational and non-cylindrical.
Form factor resembles a cabinet, enclosure, or industrial housing.
Rectilinear geometry with stacked modules, compartments, panels, and access doors.

(Asymmetrical / Frankenstein)

Asymmetrical layout with no central axis.
Multiple subsystems arranged irregularly.
Uneven proportions and non-repeating geometry.

(Drawer / Panel / Bureaucratic Horror)

Includes drawers, inspection panels, removable access plates, calibration ports, and mismatched modular attachments.
The machine appears designed for maintenance by technicians rather than elegance.

COLOR ACCENT:

Neutral whites and grays with restrained green accents.
Flat, clinical lighting. 
Isolated on a neutral mask-friendly background.
Orthographic view, centered composition.
The tone is authoritative, instructional, and quietly absurd.
No shadows.
No environmental context.
