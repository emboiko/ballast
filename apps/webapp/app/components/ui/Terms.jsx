        <ContentHeading>5. Payment Terms and Refund Policy</ContentHeading>
        <ContentSubheading>5.1 Payment Processing</ContentSubheading>
        <ContentParagraph>
          All payments for retroencabulation products and services must be made
          through our designated payment processors. By completing a purchase,
          you authorize us to charge your payment method for the full amount,
          including any applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges related to

        <ContentSubheading>5.2 Refund Policy</ContentSubheading>
        <ContentParagraph>
          All sales are final. Due to the specialized nature of

          hydrocoptic marzelvane systems, we do not offer refunds, exchanges, or
          returns unless required by applicable law. Once a prefamulated amulite
          base has been activated or a panendermic semi-boloid slot has been
          configured, the transaction is considered complete and irreversible.
        </ContentParagraph>
        <ContentParagraph>
          In the unlikely event that we determine, in our sole discretion, that
          a refund is warranted, such refund will be processed within 30-90
          business days and may be subject to administrative fees, restocking
          charges, and panendermic recalibration costs, which will be deducted
          from the refund amount.
